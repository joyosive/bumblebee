```bash
# Install Rust (if not already installed)
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown

# Build the counter contract
cd packages/bedrock
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

The compiled WASM file will be at:
```
packages/bedrock/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/counter.wasm
```

#### Deploy via UI

1. Go to the "Deploy Contract" section
2. Click "Upload WASM File" and select `counter.wasm`
3. Review the contract code (displayed in hex)

5. Approve the transaction in your wallet (requires 100 XRP fee)
6. Copy the contract address from the confirmation

### 4. Interact with Your Contract

2. Paste your contract address
3. Click "Load Counter Example" or enter a function name:
   - `increment` - Increase counter by 1
   - `decrement` - Decrease counter by 1
   - `get_value` - Get current value

4. Click "Call Contract Function"
5. Approve the transaction in your wallet

### 5. Explore the Debug Panel

The debug panel on the right shows:
